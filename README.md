# InfiniTAM-just-run
This is forked from https://github.com/victorprad/InfiniTAM and you should definitely read their readme and https://infinitam.org/ to know what this project is all about.

However, as I am absolutely opposed to giving any lengthy instructions to humans (listing dependencies and whatnot that are necessary to get this code to do what it is supposed to),
I have created automated scripts for everything required to work with this project.

# How to Run

## Ubuntu Linux
```bash
./run
```
The user running this must (initially) have sudo privileges so that dependencies can be installed.

Tested on Ubuntu 22.04.

## Windows
In `cmd` or `powershell`, initially as an admin, do:

```cmd
.\run
```
